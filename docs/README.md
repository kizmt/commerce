## 🎯 System Architecture

### Data Flow

```
1. Order Placed (Customer Signed In)

2. Shopify → POST /api/webhooks/orders/paid
   ↓
3. Check Order Metafield (idempotency)
   ↓
4. Calculate Points (subtotal × rate)
   ↓
5. Update Customer Metafield (add points)
   ↓
6. Mark Order Metafield (prevent duplicates)
```

### Redemption Flow

```
1. Customer → /account/rewards
   ↓
2. View Balance & Available Vouchers
   ↓
3. Click "Redeem" → POST /api/loyalty/redeem
   ↓
4. Create Discount Code (Shopify Admin API)
   ↓
5. Subtract Points from Customer Metafield
   ↓
6. Return Discount Code to Customer
```

### Refund Flow

```
1. Refund Created in Shopify
   ↓
2. Shopify → POST /api/webhooks/refunds/create
   ↓
3. Get Original Points Awarded (Order Metafield)
   ↓
4. Calculate Points to Subtract (refund amount × rate)
   ↓
5. Update Customer Metafield (subtract points)
```

// Test getting points
await testGetPoints();

await testRedemption(500);
```

### Sample Webhook Payloads
Use the sample payloads in `points-testing.ts` to test webhooks locally with curl or Postman.

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track
- Total points awarded
- Redemption rate (codes redeemed / codes generated)
- Average time to first redemption
- Most popular voucher levels
- Customer lifetime value with points vs without

### Webhook Health
Monitor in Shopify Admin → Settings → Notifications → Webhooks:
- Delivery success rate
- Average response time
- Failed deliveries (retry or investigate)

---

## 🔄 Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Possible Additions
- [ ] Points expiration (e.g., expire after 1 year)
- [ ] Bonus point events (double points weekends)
- [ ] Referral points (earn for referring friends)
- [ ] Tiered membership (bronze/silver/gold)
- [ ] Birthday bonus points
- [ ] Points history/transaction log
- [ ] Email notifications on point award
- [ ] Multiple currency support
- [ ] Points transfer between customers

### Implementation Notes
All of these can be added by extending the existing system without major refactoring.

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Do's
✅ Test thoroughly in Shopify's test mode first  
✅ Monitor webhook logs daily for first week  
✅ Communicate clearly to customers about earning/redemption  
✅ Start with conservative voucher levels (can always adjust)  
✅ Keep webhook secret secure (never commit to git)

### Don'ts
❌ Don't modify order metafields manually in Shopify  
❌ Don't skip HMAC verification on webhooks  
❌ Don't award points for test/draft orders  
❌ Don't forget to redeploy after changing config  
❌ Don't set points rate too high initially
