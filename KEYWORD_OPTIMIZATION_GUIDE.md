## üéØ SEO Strategy Behind These Changes

### 1. **High-Intent Keywords**
All titles include action words:
- "Buy" - Shows you're a seller
- "Shop" - Indicates transactions possible
- "Pre-Order" - Specific capability

### 2. **Location Keywords**
Every title/description includes:
- "NZ" or "New Zealand" - Geographic targeting
- "Auckland" - Your location
- Build local SEO authority

### 3. **Product Types**
Mention multiple variants:
- Booster boxes
- Singles
- Sealed products
- Graded cards
This captures more long-tail searches

### 4. **CTR Optimization**
- Titles are compelling and click-worthy
- Descriptions include benefits (fast shipping, authenticity)
- Calls-to-action implied ("Shop now", "Browse")

### 5. **Keyword Placement**
- Keywords in title (most important)
- Keywords in description (supporting)
- Keywords in metadata (indexed by Google)
- Keywords in URL (already optimized)

## üöÄ Implementation Details

### File Changes:
1. **`app/search/[collection]/page.tsx`**
   - Added `keywordTitles` object (one per collection)
   - Added `keywordDescriptions` object (one per collection)
   - Falls back to Shopify SEO fields if custom not set
   - Falls back to collection title/description if Shopify empty

2. **`app/page.tsx`**
   - Enhanced metadata with location keywords
   - Added "Auckland" to title
   - Added local search keywords
   - Improved description with geographic markers

### Fallback Chain:
For maximum flexibility:
```
1. Custom keyword title (NEW) ‚úÖ
2. Shopify SEO title (if set)
3. Collection title (default)

Same pattern for descriptions
```

This means:
- If you update Shopify titles, they'll override custom ones
- But our optimized keywords are the default baseline
- Zero dependency on manual Shopify updates

---

## üìù Customization Guide

### To Override a Collection Title:
Edit `keywordTitles` in `app/search/[collection]/page.tsx`:

```tsx
const keywordTitles: Record<string, string> = {
  "pokemon": "YOUR NEW TITLE HERE",
  // ... rest
};
```

### To Add a New Collection:
1. Create collection in Shopify with handle `my-collection`
2. Add to `keywordTitles`:
```tsx
"my-collection": "Buy My Collection Cards NZ | Singles & Booster Boxes",
```
3. Add to `keywordDescriptions`:
```tsx
"my-collection": "Shop My Collection cards in New Zealand...",
```
4. Add to `keywordMap`:
```tsx
"my-collection": [
  "My Collection NZ",
  "Buy My Collection cards",
  // ... more keywords
],
```
