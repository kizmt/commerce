🔗 INTEGRATION WITH SHOPIFY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If you set Shopify SEO titles, they WILL OVERRIDE our custom keywords:

  • Our keywords: Fallback default

This is intentional - allows flexibility while providing defaults


✨ WHY THIS MATTERS

  ❌ Google doesn't understand what your pages are about
  ❌ Won't rank for specific searches
  ❌ Low CTR - titles aren't compelling

With keyword optimization:
  ✅ Google knows you sell Pokemon cards in NZ
  ✅ Ranks for "Pokemon TCG NZ" searches
  ✅ High CTR - compelling titles
  ✅ Local authority - mentions Auckland
