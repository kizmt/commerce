## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### For Shopify Users:
If you set SEO titles in Shopify, they will **OVERRIDE** our keywords:
```
Priority: Shopify SEO field > Our custom keywords > Collection title
```

This is intentional - allows flexibility while providing smart defaults.

### For Google:
Google takes 3-5 days to re-crawl after major changes. Don't panic if you don't see immediate changes. That's normal!

### For Monitoring:
Start checking Search Console in 3-5 days. Look for:
- Reduction in "redirect" warnings
- Consolidation of "duplicate content" pages
- New queries appearing for target keywords
