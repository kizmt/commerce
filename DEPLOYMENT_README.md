## Deployment Steps

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Have write access to git repository
- [ ] Have deployment access to Vercel/hosting
- [ ] Have access to Google Search Console

### Step 1: Review Changes (NOW)
```bash
# View all modified files
git status

# Review specific changes
git diff app/search/page.tsx
git diff app/robots.ts
git diff app/product/[handle]/page.tsx
```

Expected changes:
- 7 files modified
- 1 new file (middleware.ts)
- +150 lines of code
- 0 lines removed (additive changes only)

### Step 2: Commit and Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(seo): Phase 1 - Fix critical SEO issues

- Standardize all canonical URLs with baseUrl
- Add missing Product schema fields (review, aggregateRating, offerCount)
- Mark account pages explicitly as noindex
- Harden robots.txt with disallow rules for /api/ and /account/
- Add middleware security layer for private routes
- Add explicit robots index directives to search pages

Fixes:
- Duplicate content issues from query parameters
- Product snippet schema validation errors
- Private routes potentially being indexed
- Redirect chains in OAuth flow

Expected Impact:
- 100+ duplicate pages consolidated to canonical
- Product rich snippets enabled
- Search indexation improved in 3-5 days"
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Production
```bash
# If using Vercel CLI:
vercel deploy --prod

# Or push to main branch (if auto-deploy configured):
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment (24 hours)
```
‚úì Check sitemap.xml generates correctly
‚úì Check robots.txt includes new disallow rules
‚úì Verify metadata in View Page Source
‚úì Check Search Console for crawl activity
```

## Monitoring Checklist

### Daily (First Week)
- [ ] Check Google Search Console for new errors
- [ ] Monitor server logs for excessive crawling
- [ ] Quick sanity check on homepage/product pages

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues occur post-deployment:

### Immediate Rollback (< 1 hour)
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### What to Check Before Rollback
1. Are 404 errors appearing? (Check hosting status)
2. Is the site completely down? (Check domain/DNS)
3. Are pages not loading? (Check application status)

### Issues That DON'T Require Rollback
- Google showing "redirect" warnings (expected, will resolve)
- Duplicate page warnings (expected, will consolidate)
- Slow indexation (expected, takes time)
- Search Console errors (expected initially)
